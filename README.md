## Second way:
### Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/matisluzi/techfind-ionic/releases) page.
*Note: I will try my best to publish a new release for every new version, but if you want to be absolutely sure that you have the latest changes, use the first way.*
- If you have an **iOS** device, use [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) to sideload the **IPA** file onto your device.
- If you have an **Android** device, simply open the **APK** file to install the app on your device.
